# Hangman
A game made developed by me.

The Hangman.py file consists of the primitive code that I did while trying to implement GUI using tkinter 
for the first time.

Hangman.exe is the game converted from the Python source file through py2exe.

Please do not tamper the files along with Hangman.exe as they are a part of the GUI and the game.

Thank you for playing.
